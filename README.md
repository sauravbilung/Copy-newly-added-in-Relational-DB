Requirement : Table 2 should be in sync with Table 1. Table 2 is the final table from where data is referred. Table 1 and Table 2 have same records. Table 1 gets the new record(s). Our task is to identify the new record(s) and copy it to table 2.

Constraints : No date related fields are available to identify the latest record(s).

This is a simple solution for that. Of course it can be done in many ways. ðŸ˜Š
